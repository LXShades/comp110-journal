# What is a journal
I'm not even sure what a journal is, but since it was said to be a good place to write thoughts, I'll write them here and call it a journal.

## On Djikstra, the author of the go to paper
The influence of his paper in the public eye was not immediate. Indeed the author himself, Dijkstra, was the responsible for a popular pathfinding algorithm of the same name. It was therefore reasonable to assume that the motive behind his dislike of the 'go to' statement, was largely due to the fact that having a single statement to simply 'go to' a destination in code linearly would be far, far too easy for the programmer.  

While there are few who have studied deeply into this perspective--perhaps none at all--it is widely accepted that spaghetti code is malnutritious without a healthy algorithmic sauce.
